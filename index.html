                            <span style="color: #439e8d;">How do you resolve the issues/challenges in the project?</span><br>

                                - In my previous project, implementing multi-language support was a significant 
                                challenge. As we aimed to cater to a diverse user base across different regions, 
                                providing content in multiple languages was essential for a better user experience.<br><br>

                                - For this, firstly, we conducted an extensive research to understand the language 
                                preferences of our target audience in various regions. This helped us to 
                                prioritize the languages.<br><br>
                                
                                - Then we integrated an internationalization framework, which is react-i18next, 
                                into our frontend architecture. This framework provided tools for managing 
                                language files, detecting user language preferences and dynamically rendering 
                                translated content. <br><br>
                                
                                - Next, we focused on content localization. We separated our codebase and 
                                extracted all static textual content like labels, buttons and messages into 
                                separate language files. This helped us for easier translation and maintenance.<br><br>
                                
                                - So, now they are fetched and displayed according to the userâ€™s language 
                                preferences in their browser. Throughout this process, we collaborated with 
                                translators and native speakers to ensure our translated content is correct.<br><br>

                            <span style="color: #439e8d;">What can we expect from you if we hire you?</span><br>

                                - I bring 10+ years of experience along with me. The experience I had in various 
                                domains and the work that I did in different roles. I am skilled in UI/UX design, 
                                frontend development using modern frameworks and also the skills I possess in 
                                backend with node.js and RESTful APIs.<br><br>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                Hello, my name is Sai Srujan Penta. I am currently working as a Senior Frontend Engineer with 
                Ameriprise. With over a decade of experience in the Software Development Life Cycle, I have refined
                 my skills in various technical phases from requirement analysis to testing. My expertise lies in 
                 frontend development, particularly in technologies like Angular JS, React JS, and Next JS, 
                 alongside a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Typescript. <br><br>
                
                 In my current role, I focus on designing and developing innovative frontend solutions, ensuring 
                 responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility for a consistent user experience. I'm currently working
                 on an Automated Investment Advisory platform. It makes personalized financial advice accessible to everyone 
                 by using advanced technologies. Users get automated investment suggestions that match their goals and preferences. 
                 Utilizing my expertise, I've put up a powerful technology stack for our application, using React 
                 Redux for state management, Next.js for routing, MongoDB as our database, and Node.js with 
                 Express.js for backend functionality and database interaction. Additionally, I've implemented JWT 
                 tokens to enhance security, ensuring safe communication and controlled access. <br><br>

                 I have a strong understanding of Document Object Model (DOM) and its functions, along with 
                 extensive knowledge and experience in developing Single Page Applications (SPAs) using frameworks 
                 like React JS, Backbone.js, and Bootstrap. Additionally, I am proficient in integrating React 
                 applications with RESTful APIs and GraphQL, specializing in modern patterns like GraphQL 
                 subscriptions for real-time data updates. This skill is particularly crucial in the finance 
                 domain, where I currently work. <br><br>

                 Additionally, I have hands-on experience deploying applications on AWS cloud services, setting up 
                 DevOps pipelines with Jenkins, and ensuring secure communication and storage practices to minimize 
                 risks. My commitment towards continuous improvement is evident through my involvement in

                <h3>SDLC</h3>
                Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software development teams 
                to design, develop, test and deploy high-quality software systems. It consists of a series of phases,<br><br>

                Requirement Analysis: In this phase, stakeholders collaborate to gather and analyze requirements 
                for the software system. They understand the needs of the end-users, define functional and 
                non-functional requirements and document these requirements properly.<br><br>

                Design: During the design phase, the system architecture, data structures, interfaces and algorithms
                 are designed based on the gathered requirements. In this phase, we come up with detailed technical 
                 specifications, architecture diagrams and design documents and these will be used as blueprints in 
                 the upcoming phases.<br><br>

                Implementation: In the Implementation phase, developers write code based on the specifications and 
                designs created in the previous phases. Here, they translate the design documents into executable 
                software components, following coding standards and best practices and integrating various modules 
                to build the complete system.<br><br>

                Testing: In the testing phase we verify and validate the software to ensure that it meets the 
                specified requirements and functions correctly. Different types of testing, such as unit testing, 
                integration testing, systems testing and acceptance testing are performed to identify and fix 
                defects and ensure software quality.<br><br>

                Deployment: Once the software has been thoroughly tested and approved, it is deployed to production.
                 This involves configuring the software environment, installing the application on target systems 
                 and ensuring that it functions as expected in the production environment.<br><br>

                Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is actively 
                supported, monitored and updated to address issues, add new features or accommodate changes in 
                user requirements. Maintenance activities may include bug fixes, performance optimization, 
                security updates and enhancements to existing functionality.<br><br>

                is broken down into reusable components.<br><br>
               It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the UI. It calculates the 
               difference between the previous and current states of the virtual DOM and only applies necessary 
               changes to the real DOM, resulting in the improved performance.<br><br>
               It uses JSX as its syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing us to write HTML-like code in 
               JavaScript files.<br><br>
               It encourages unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows in a single direction through the

                <h3>JavaScript</h3>

                JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building dynamic 
                and interactive web applications.<br><br>

                JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the user's web 
                browser rather than on the server. This allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user 
                interfaces that respond to user actions in real-time without needing to reload the entire web page.<br><br>

                JavaScript is commonly used for web development to add interactivity, validate user input, 
                manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle events, and perform asynchronous operations 
                like fetching data from servers (AJAX).<br><br>

            <section id="ts">
                <h3>TypeScript</h3>

                TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, which allows us to define types for variables, 
                function parameters, return values etc. This helps in identifying type-related errors during 
                development and it helps in documenting the code better and it's now more readable.<br><br>

                It features type inference, which means that the compiler can automatically infer the types of 
                variables based on their usage. With this, we donâ€™t have to specifically mention the type, so 
                the development process gets a little faster.<br><br>

                It offers better tooling support, including features like code navigation, intelligent code 
                completion and refactoring tools. So, this improves our productivity and will help us maintain 
                large codespaces better.<br><br>

            <section id="jsts">
                <h3>Difference between JavaScript and TypeScript</h3>

                TypeScript allows developers to define types for variables, function parameters, return values, 
                and other entities. JavaScript, on the other hand, is dynamically typed, meaning types are 
                determined at runtime rather than at compile time.<br><br>

                In TypeScript, developers can explicitly annotate variables, function parameters, and other 
                entities with types. JavaScript does not support type annotations.<br><br>

                TypeScript features type inference, where the compiler can automatically deduce the types of 
                variables based on their usage. JavaScript does not have type inference.<br><br>

                TypeScript performs static type checking at compile time, catching type-related errors before the 
                code is executed. JavaScript, being dynamically typed, does not have this level of compile-time 
                checking and may only catch type-related errors at runtime.<br><br>

                JSON Web Tokens are a secure way of transmitting information between parties in a web application. <br><br>

                Essentially, they're like digital passports that contain user-related information. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT token, which is then sent to the client. <br><br>

                This token is typically stored on the client side, either in local storage or as a cookie. <br><br>

                Whenever the user makes a request to the server, they include this token in the request. The server can then verify the token to ensure that the request is coming from an authenticated user and has the necessary permissions to access the requested resources. <br><br>

                JWT tokens are widely used for authentication and authorization in web applications due to their security and efficiency.<br><br>

                <h3>DOM</h3>

                Document Object Model, or DOM, is essentially the way web browsers represent web pages internally. <br><br>

                It creates a structured representation of the HTML elements on a web page, forming a tree-like structure where each element, like paragraphs, headings, or buttons, is a node in the tree. <br><br>

                This allows developers to use JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically. <br><br>

                For example, you can use the DOM to access elements on a web page, change their content or appearance, respond to user interactions like clicks or keystrokes, and even create or remove elements altogether. <br><br>

                Unlike traditional multi-page applications, which require loading a new page from the server every time the user interacts with the application, SPAs load all necessary code  when the user first accesses the application. <br><br>

                From there, interactions with the application are handled dynamically on the client side, typically using JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Backbone.js. <br><br>

                This approach provides a smoother and more seamless user experience, as content updates happen quickly without the need for full page reloads. <br><br>

                In simpler terms, they're a way of building web services that are easy to understand and use. RESTful APIs are based on the idea of treating resources as unique identifiers that can be manipulated using a standardized set of operations. <br><br>

                These operations include things like creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources, which map to the HTTP methods of POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE respectively.<br><br>

                RESTful APIs use standard HTTP protocols and status codes to communicate between clients and servers, making them highly interoperable and easy to integrate with existing web technologies. <br><br>

                In simpler terms, it's like setting up a live connection between the client and server, so the server can push updates to the client whenever certain events occur. <br><br>

                This is particularly useful for applications where users need to see real-time updates, like chat apps or live feeds. <br><br>

                <h3>Less/Sass</h3>

                Less and Sass are both CSS preprocessors, which means they are tools that extend the functionality of CSS. <br><br> 

                Less and Sass introduce enhancements to the CSS syntax, such as variables, mixins, nesting, and inheritance. These features make CSS code more modular, maintainable, and easier to write. <br><br> 

                Both of them allow developers to define variables to store values like colors, sizes, and fonts. This makes it simple to update these values across the stylesheet and ensures consistency throughout the design. <br><br> 

                They support nesting of CSS selectors, allowing developers to write CSS in a more hierarchical and structured manner. This nesting mirrors the structure of HTML markup, making the styles easier to understand and maintain.<br><br> 

                <h4 style="font-weight: bolder; color: rgb(72, 143, 119);">Differences between Less&Sass</h4>

                Less uses a CSS-like syntax with minimal changes, while Sass has its own syntax, which is more expressive and powerful.<br><br>

                Sass has a more extensive feature set, including powerful features like control directives (@if, @for, @each, @while), placeholders (%placeholder), and modules (@use and @import).<br><br>

                Less has a simpler feature set compared to Sass, with fewer built-in functions and features.<br><br>

                <h3>AJAX</h3>

                AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a web development technique used to create interactive and dynamic web applications. <br><br> 

                This enables web pages to send and receive data from a server asynchronously, meaning it can perform tasks in the background without interfering with the user's experience on the webpage. <br><br> 

                With AJAX, web pages can update specific parts of the page dynamically without requiring a full page reload. This allows for a smoother and more responsive user experience. <br><br> 

                Many JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as jQuery, AngularJS, and React, provide built-in support for AJAX<br><br>
                
                AJAX is commonly used for features such as form submissions, live search suggestions, auto-complete fields, and updating content dynamically without reloading the entire page.<br><br>

                A NoSQL database is a type of database system that differs from traditional SQL databases in how it stores and manages data. While SQL databases use a structured, tabular 
                format with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases employ a more flexible and dynamic approach to data storage. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or 
                semi-structured data, such as documents, graphs, key-value pairs, or wide-column stores, which may not fit neatly into the rows and columns of a relational database. 
                NoSQL databases are often used in scenarios where scalability, flexibility, and performance are paramount, such as web applications, big data analytics, and real-time

                <h3>Micro-Frontend</h3>
                Micro frontends and microservices are architectural approaches used in software development to build large and complex applications.<br><br>

                Micro frontends apply the principles of microservices to the frontend development. They involve breaking down a large frontend application into smaller, more manageable parts, each of which is developed and deployed independently. These parts, or micro frontends, can be developed using different technologies and can be managed by different teams. They are then composed together to form the final user interface.<br><br>

                On the other hand, microservices are an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices communicate with each other over the network using lightweight protocols such as HTTP or messaging queues.<br><br>

                Module Federation, a concept introduced by Webpack, is a technique that enables the creation of micro frontends by allowing different parts of a frontend application to be developed and deployed independently while still being able to share code and resources.<br><br>

            <section id="redux">
                <h3>Redux</h3>

                React Redux is used in React applications for managing the application's state. It's based on the principles of Flux, which highlights the unidirectional data flow. Redux helps manage the state of your application in a predictable way, making it easier to understand and debug.<br><br>

                Redux works by maintaining the application state in a single immutable state tree, called the store. Components can dispatch actions to the store, which are plain JavaScript objects describing what happened. Reducers, pure functions, then specify how the state should change in response to actions, producing a new state.<br><br>

                React components can subscribe to the store, and whenever the state in the store changes, they are automatically re-rendered with the new data. This decouples the state management logic from the components, making them more reusable and easier to test.<br><br>

                Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. They are responsible for updating the state based on the action type. Reducers should be pure functions, which means they should not mutate the state directly. Instead, they should return a new state object with the updated data.<br><br>

                In React, keys are special attributes that are used to uniquely identify elements in a collection of elements. When rendering a list of elements, React uses keys to track which items have changed, are added, or are removed.<br><br>

                Keys help React identify which items in the list have changed, are added, or are removed. This allows React to efficiently update the UI without re-rendering all the elements in the list.<br><br>

                <h3>Hooks in React</h3>

                Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced in React 16.8 to allow functional components to have state and lifecycle features that were previously only available in class components.<br><br>

                Hooks are functions that start with 'use' (e.g., useState, useEffect) and can be called inside functional components to add state or side effects. The most commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef.<br><br>

                useState allows you to add state to functional components.<br><br>
                useEffect lets you perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.<br><br>
