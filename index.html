                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                Hello, my name is Sai Srujan Penta. I am currently working as a Senior Frontend Engineer with 
                Ameriprise. With over a decade of experience in the Software Development Life Cycle, I have refined
                 my skills in various technical phases from requirement analysis to testing. My expertise lies in 
                 frontend development, particularly in technologies like Angular JS, React JS, and Next JS, 
                 alongside a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Typescript. <br><br>
                
                 In my current role, I focus on designing and developing innovative frontend solutions, ensuring 
                 responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility for a consistent user experience. Currently, I'm 
                 working on a project to develop an exclusive employee portal with different dashboard pages, 
                 providing our team with quick access to essential metrics for our internal operations. 
                 Utilizing my expertise, I've put up a powerful technology stack for our application, using React 
                 Redux for state management, Next.js for routing, MongoDB as our database, and Node.js with 
                 Express.js for backend functionality and database interaction. Additionally, I've implemented JWT 
                 tokens to enhance security, ensuring safe communication and controlled access. This integrated 
                 approach enables me to build a robust, scalable, and secure web application with component-based 
                 architecture. <br><br>

                 I have a strong understanding of Document Object Model (DOM) and its functions, along with 
                 extensive knowledge and experience in developing Single Page Applications (SPAs) using frameworks 
                 like React JS, Backbone.js, and Bootstrap. Additionally, I am proficient in integrating React 
                 applications with RESTful APIs and GraphQL, specializing in modern patterns like GraphQL 
                 subscriptions for real-time data updates. This skill is particularly crucial in the finance 
                 domain, where I currently work. <br><br>

                 Additionally, I have hands-on experience deploying applications on AWS cloud services, setting up 
                 DevOps pipelines with Jenkins, and ensuring secure communication and storage practices to minimize 
                 risks. My commitment towards continuous improvement is evident through my involvement in 
                 test-driven development, CI/CD processes, and utilization of testing tools like Jasmine and Jest.<br><br>

                 As I am an integral part of the agile development process, where we follow a two week sprint cycle,
                  which involves daily scrum meetings to keep the team aligned with the project goals and our 
                  progress. I use Git and tools like JIRA for version control and collaboration, making it easy to 
                  manage code and work together with my team. Beyond coding, I find fulfillment in mentoring junior 
                  team members and actively participating in cross-functional meetings. My aim is not just to 
                  deliver solutions but also to empower and support talent while achieving meaningful results 
                  through technology.<br><br>

            <section id="sdlc">
                <h3>SDLC</h3>
                Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software development teams 
                to design, develop, test and deploy high-quality software systems. It consists of a series of phases,<br><br>

                Requirement Analysis: In this phase, stakeholders collaborate to gather and analyze requirements 
                for the software system. They understand the needs of the end-users, define functional and 
                non-functional requirements and document these requirements properly.<br><br>

                Design: During the design phase, the system architecture, data structures, interfaces and algorithms
                 are designed based on the gathered requirements. In this phase, we come up with detailed technical 
                 specifications, architecture diagrams and design documents and these will be used as blueprints in 
                 the upcoming phases.<br><br>

                Implementation: In the Implementation phase, developers write code based on the specifications and 
                designs created in the previous phases. Here, they translate the design documents into executable 
                software components, following coding standards and best practices and integrating various modules 
                to build the complete system.<br><br>

                Testing: In the testing phase we verify and validate the software to ensure that it meets the 
                specified requirements and functions correctly. Different types of testing, such as unit testing, 
                integration testing, systems testing and acceptance testing are performed to identify and fix 
                defects and ensure software quality.<br><br>

                Deployment: Once the software has been thoroughly tested and approved, it is deployed to production.
                 This involves configuring the software environment, installing the application on target systems 
                 and ensuring that it functions as expected in the production environment.<br><br>

                Maintenance: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is actively 
                supported, monitored and updated to address issues, add new features or accommodate changes in 
                user requirements. Maintenance activities may include bug fixes, performance optimization, 
                security updates and enhancements to existing functionality.<br><br>

            <section id="angularjs">
                <h3>Angular JS</h3>

                It is a JavaScript framework and is used to build user interfaces.<br><br>
                It is developed by Google (In 2010) and it follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture 
                for structuring the applications.<br><br>
                It provides built-in support for features like routing, form validation and dependency injection.<br><br>
                It uses HTML as a template language with additional syntax and directives.<br><br>
                It uses two-way data binding, meaning changes in the UI elements are automatically reflected in the 
                underlying data model and vice versa.<br><br>
                
            </section>

            <section id="reactjs">
                <h3>React JS</h3>

                It is a JavaScript framework and is used for building user interfaces.<br><br>
                It is developed by Facebook(In 2013), and it follows a component-based architecture, where the UI 
                is broken down into reusable components.<br><br>
               It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the UI. It calculates the 
               difference between the previous and current states of the virtual DOM and only applies necessary 
               changes to the real DOM, resulting in the improved performance.<br><br>
               It uses JSX as its syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing us to write HTML-like code in 
               JavaScript files.<br><br>
               It encourages unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows in a single direction through the 
               component hierarchy. <br><br>

            <section id="nextjs">
                <h3>Next JS</h3>

                Next.js is a popular framework for building React applications and was initially released in 2016.<br><br>
                It allows server-side rendering, which means that pages are rendered on the server before being 
                sent to the client’s browser. This can improve performance and SEO by delivering fully rendered 
                HTML pages to the client.<br><br>

                It provides a built-in routing system that allows us to define routes for the application’s pages.<br><br>

                HTML is the  latest version of the HTML standard used for structuring and presenting content on the 
                World Wide Web.<br><br>
                HTML5 introduces new features and enhancements that improve the capabilities of web pages and 
                applications, making them more dynamic, interactive, and multimedia-rich.<br><br>
                HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like header, footer, nav, article, section, and 
                aside, which provide clearer and more meaningful structure to web documents. These elements help 
                improve accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and code readability.<br><br>

            <section id="js">
                <h3>JavaScript</h3>

                JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building dynamic 
                and interactive web applications.<br><br>

                JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs on the user's web 
                browser rather than on the server. This allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user 
                interfaces that respond to user actions in real-time without needing to reload the entire web page.<br><br>

                JavaScript is commonly used for web development to add interactivity, validate user input, 
                manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle events, and perform asynchronous operations 
                like fetching data from servers (AJAX).<br><br>



            </section>

            <section id="ts">
                <h3>TypeScript</h3>

                TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript, which allows us to define types for variables, 
                function parameters, return values etc. This helps in identifying type-related errors during 
                development and it helps in documenting the code better and it's now more readable.<br><br>

                It features type inference, which means that the compiler can automatically infer the types of 
                variables based on their usage. With this, we don’t have to specifically mention the type, so 
                the development process gets a little faster.<br><br>

                It offers better tooling support, including features like code navigation, intelligent code 
                completion and refactoring tools. So, this improves our productivity and will help us maintain 
                large codespaces better.<br><br>

            <section id="jsts">
                <h3>Difference between JavaScript and TypeScript</h3>

                TypeScript allows developers to define types for variables, function parameters, return values, 
                and other entities. JavaScript, on the other hand, is dynamically typed, meaning types are 
                determined at runtime rather than at compile time.<br><br>

                In TypeScript, developers can explicitly annotate variables, function parameters, and other 
                entities with types. JavaScript does not support type annotations.<br><br>

                TypeScript features type inference, where the compiler can automatically deduce the types of 
                variables based on their usage. JavaScript does not have type inference.<br><br>

                TypeScript performs static type checking at compile time, catching type-related errors before the 
                code is executed. JavaScript, being dynamically typed, does not have this level of compile-time 
                checking and may only catch type-related errors at runtime.<br><br>

            <section id="redux">
                <h3>React Redux</h3>

                React Redux is a library used for state management in React applications.<br><br> 

                It provides a centralized store to manage the application's state, enabling components to access 
                and update the state without having to pass data through props. <br><br>

                The connect function allows components to connect to the Redux store and access the state or 
                dispatch actions, improving performance by selectively subscribing to relevant parts of the state. <br><br>

                Additionally, React Redux supports middleware for intercepting and modifying actions, and it 
                integrates with the Redux DevTools extension for powerful debugging capabilities.<br><br>

            <section id="mongodb">
                <h3>MongoDB Database</h3>

                MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of 
                use. <br><br>

                It stores data in flexible JSON-like documents, making it suitable for handling unstructured and 
                semi-structured data. <br><br>

                It supports dynamic schemas, horizontal scalability through sharding, and built-in replication for 
                high availability.<br><br>

                It is commonly used in modern web applications, mobile app backends, real-time analytics, and 
                content management systems. It is well-suited for applications requiring flexible data models, 
                rapid development cycles, and scalability.<br><br>

                <h3>JWT Tokens</h3>

                JSON Web Tokens are a secure way of transmitting information between parties in a web application. <br><br>

                Essentially, they're like digital passports that contain user-related information. When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT token, which is then sent to the client. <br><br>

                This token is typically stored on the client side, either in local storage or as a cookie. <br><br>

                Whenever the user makes a request to the server, they include this token in the request. The server can then verify the token to ensure that the request is coming from an authenticated user and has the necessary permissions to access the requested resources. <br><br>

                JWT tokens are widely used for authentication and authorization in web applications due to their security and efficiency.<br><br>

                <h3>DOM</h3>

                Document Object Model, or DOM, is essentially the way web browsers represent web pages internally. <br><br>

                It creates a structured representation of the HTML elements on a web page, forming a tree-like structure where each element, like paragraphs, headings, or buttons, is a node in the tree. <br><br>

                This allows developers to use JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically. <br><br>

                For example, you can use the DOM to access elements on a web page, change their content or appearance, respond to user interactions like clicks or keystrokes, and even create or remove elements altogether. <br><br>

            <section id="spa">
                <h3>Single Page Applications</h3>

                Single Page Applications are a type of web application where the entire application runs on a single web page. <br><br>

                Unlike traditional multi-page applications, which require loading a new page from the server every time the user interacts with the application, SPAs load all necessary code  when the user first accesses the application. <br><br>

                From there, interactions with the application are handled dynamically on the client side, typically using JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Backbone.js. <br><br>

                This approach provides a smoother and more seamless user experience, as content updates happen quickly without the need for full page reloads. <br><br>

                In simpler terms, it's like setting up a live connection between the client and server, so the server can push updates to the client whenever certain events occur. <br><br>

                This is particularly useful for applications where users need to see real-time updates, like chat apps or live feeds. <br><br>

                Instead of the client having to constantly ask the server for updates, GraphQL subscriptions enable a more efficient and responsive way of handling real-time data.<br><br>

                <h3>SQL Server</h3>

                SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It is designed to store and manage large volumes of data efficiently, providing robust data management, analysis, and reporting capabilities.<br><br>

                As an RDBMS, SQL Server organizes data into tables consisting of rows and columns, with each table representing a different entity. It supports the SQL for querying and manipulating data, allowing us to perform tasks such as retrieving, updating, inserting, and deleting data from the database. <br><br>

                <h3>No SQL</h3>

                A NoSQL database is a type of database system that differs from traditional SQL databases in how it stores and manages data. While SQL databases use a structured, tabular 
                format with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases employ a more flexible and dynamic approach to data storage. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or 
                semi-structured data, such as documents, graphs, key-value pairs, or wide-column stores, which may not fit neatly into the rows and columns of a relational database. 
                NoSQL databases are often used in scenarios where scalability, flexibility, and performance are paramount, such as web applications, big data analytics, and real-time 
                data processing.<br><br>
